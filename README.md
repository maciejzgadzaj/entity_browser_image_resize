# Entity Browser Image Resize

Automatically resizes original images uploaded using [Entity Browser](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_browser) module.

Resizing is being done based on dedicated `Entity Browser Image Resize` image style created during module installation, after clicking `Select entities` button in the entity browser pop-up.

The image style can be deleted or renamed (machine name) to avoid automatic resizing.

## Installation

 - Enable the module.
 - Edit new `Entity Browser Image Resize` image style to match your requirements.
